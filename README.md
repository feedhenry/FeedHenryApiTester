## About this project
This app is for testing many of the FeedHenry client APIs. Hope we will not adding more feature device APIs as we will ask people to use Cordova APIs instead, but at least we need to keep backward compatibiltiy.

If customers raise issues about some APIs and is not covered by this app, please add new tests for the issues.

Notes:

* To test push notification, you need to make sure the app is built with push notification enabled from the studio.
* Some APIs may not working across all platforms e.g. audio.
* At the moment, it's not easy to test the files API as it requires server components. I hope will implement a file server in the cloud soon.
